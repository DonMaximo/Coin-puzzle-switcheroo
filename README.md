# Coin-puzzle-switcheroo
A coin puzzle game simulated using python

Coinpuzzle.py is a program that simulates a simple coin game. 

The game rules are such:
You have a row of squares with m and n pennies and dimes respectively and a number of spaces between them,
this is a configuration.
A single move is sliding a coin over into an empty space, or hopping an adjacent coin and landing into an empty space. 
The program finds the fewest number of moves to get from one configuration to another using an adjacency set graph.
